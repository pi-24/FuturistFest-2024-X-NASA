# FuturistFest-2024-X-NASA

Sound of Space

Participants will embark on an innovative exploration of NASA's open-source data to transform cosmic sights into auditory experiences. Explore astronomical phenomena such as supernovae explosions, pulsar signals, planetary atmospheres, and galactic collisions, and transform them into compelling audio representations. Your soundscapes should not only convey scientific information but also evoke a sense of wonder and awe.

Must utilize NASAâ€™s open-source data from https://data.nasa.gov/ or https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/ (must end in .nasa.gov)

Participants are required to submit a presentation containing no more than 25 slides.

In the presentation, there should be a reference page for every open-source data used.
Additionally, they must provide a link to a demo or prototype showcasing their project. 

Participants should also submit a link to their project's source code, which will be evaluated for coding elegance.
